What I worked on 2020-21.
Using a code called epScript for the game called, Starcraft: Remastered.

Github detected this project as a python project but it is a epScript project.
It is because epScript is based on a library called EUDplib on python.

Every work I have done ended with .eps extension.
You can find my codes in following directories >>  (Map_Name)/BulidData_(Map_Name)/eudplibData/TriggerEditor/
